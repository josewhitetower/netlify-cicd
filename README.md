# Quick CI/CD with Netlify :rocket:
__This guide sets up the following flow of events:__
1. Creating a ~~gatsby~~ NextJS project and push it to your github repository.
2. Hooking up Netflify to build and deploy your application.
3. Making changes to our app and opening a new pull request.

4. You push your branch to your GitHub repository and create a pull request.
5. Netlify automatically creates a preview of the site with a unique URL that can be shared.
6. Travis CI automatically builds the site in an isolated container and runs any declared tests.
7. When all tests pass, you merge the PR into the repositoryâ€™s master branch, which automatically triggers a deployment to your production Linode.

## Create a NextJS application
Generate a NextJS project and when prompted name it `netlify-cicd`
```js
npx create-next-app
```
Verify our app runs as expected
```sh
cd next-app && npm run dev
```
Providing our app runs as expected we can now create a new GitHub repo and name it `netlify-cicd`

Commit our code to the repo we've just created
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "starter application"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/netlify-cicd.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Hook up Netlify
Navigate to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start) and login using your GitHub account

Create a 'New Site from Git' which includes three steps:
1. Connecting to GitHub
2. Pick your repo
3. Specify your build options (default should be fine) & Deploy!
   
![Create a new site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EoinTraynor/netlify-cicd/master/demo_assets/CreateSiteOnNetlify.png "Create a new site")

 * Branch to deploy: You can specify a branch to monitor. When you push to that particular branch, only then will Netlify build and deploy the site. The default is master.
 * Build Command: You can specify the command you want Netlify to run when you push to the above branch. The default is npm run build.
 * Publish directory: You can specify which folder Netlify should use to host the website, e.g., public, dist, build. The default is public.
 * Advanced build settings: If the site needs environment variables to build, you can specify them by clicking on Show advanced and then the New Variable button.

Deploy logs can viewed at 'Site deploy in progress' and once this has finalized your site will be available at the generated URL :rocket:

## Making changes and creating a new pull request
Create a new local branch
```sh
git checkout -b "update/site-heading"
```

In our `src/pages/index.js` update to our header tag to `<h1>Hello Netlify Preview</h1>`

Now we can commit our changes to our repo and open a new pull request to our master branch.

Netlify will watch our repository for opened pull requests and build and deploy a preview version of our app with all of our new changes. We can see this in the pull request checks.

This enables teammates to see exactly what changes have been made without having to pull down the branch locally or before it's merged to our master branch :sunglasses:



> Status checks are based on external processes, such as continuous integration builds, which run for each push you make to a repository. You can see the pending, passing, or failing state of status checks next to individual commits in your pull request.
> If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your branch into the protected branch. For more information, see "About required status checks."
